# Enhanced OCR Application with Robot Frameowrk wrapper
----

### 1. Broad Area of Work
The project is aimed at the areas of test automation, image processing and machine
learning. It seeks to improve the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology in the
Robot Framework with a view to advancing the automation of industrial testing tasks. The
focus is on solving the problems of noisy text, font and language diversity, and the
performance of the system in real time conditions.

### 2. Objectives
- Enhance existing OCR systems that are capable of working on noisy, multilingual
sources in different font styles more reliably and more precisely than they do currently.
- Implement an OCR system as a library of the Robot Framework where the OCR system
is of a suitable design to allow users to Convert OCR into a global standard.
- Provide further image enhancement techniques such as de-noising, skew removal and
region of interest to improve the overall performance of the proposed OCR. â€¢ Allow the
data to be processed on real time basis to improve the speed and efficiency in the
recognition and verification of text during automated testing.
- Encourage the community to collaborate by releasing the tool on GitHub with
appropriate descriptions, manuals, and examples.

### 3. Scope of Work
- **Problem Identification:** A thorough reassessment of current OCR systems in use and
formulation of models for their enhancement about dynamic text input.
- **Solution Development:** Constructing a new OCR system based on more sophisticated
machine learning models including CNNs and RNNs for improved performance in multitesting
environments.
- **Integration:** Arrange the OCR system as a Robot Framework library, with relevant tools
such as architecture for real-time monitoring and pre-processing.
- **Global Accessibility:** Upload the library to GitHub to enable developers and testers from
different countries and able to foster cross-industry adaptation in manufacturing, retail,
software QA, and many others.
- **Documentation and Demonstration:** Do research study with examples of documents, real
or fictitious test cases, and tutorials on how to use the tool so that it can be easily
understood and adopted.
- **Community Contribution:** Crowd source collaboration from the global automation
community to ensure perpetual enhancement of the output.
